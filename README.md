# Building a Robust Database Solution for a Local Community Centre in Aberdeen

### **Introduction**

In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database solution for a local community centre in Aberdeen. Leveraging MySQL Workbench, I created an effective data model that supports room bookings and attendance for numerous activities. In this article, I will provide an overview of the project, discussing the design process, data management system, SQL queries, and collaboration with stakeholders.

### **Designing the Database**
To begin the project, I utilized a conceptual model known as an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). This diagram served as a blueprint, guiding the design process and ensuring data integrity. By understanding the community centre's requirements, I translated business needs into technical specifications, creating appropriate tables, relationships, and constraints within the database. The ERD was done using an app called quick database diagrams.

### **Key Tables and Relationships**
The database consists of several interconnected tables that capture essential information about members, class activities, instructors, bookings, and attendance. Each table was designed to store specific data and maintain relationships with other tables. For example, the "activity_bookings" table records information about member bookings, linking to the "members" and "class_activities" tables through foreign keys.

### **Data Management System**
To ensure smooth operation and efficient data handling, I implemented an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. This process allowed me to import and transform data from various sources into the MySQL database. The ETL process facilitated accurate room bookings and attendance management by maintaining data consistency and integrity.

### **Working with SQL**
To query and manipulate data within the database, I utilized SQL language extensively. SQL provided the necessary tools to retrieve information, update records, and generate reports. With SQL, I could extract valuable insights from the data, helping the community centre make informed decisions and evaluate their activities' success.

### **Collaboration with Stakeholders**
Throughout the project, I actively engaged with stakeholders, including community centre staff and management. I gathered their requirements and feedback and ensured the database solution met their specific needs. Effective communication with non-technical stakeholders was crucial in understanding their goals and delivering a solution that exceeded their expectations.

### **Testing and Documentation**
To ensure data accuracy and completeness, I conducted thorough testing of the database solution. I validated the system's functionality by performing extensive test cases, identifying and resolving any issues, and guaranteeing data quality. Additionally, I created comprehensive documentation to support the ongoing maintenance and evolution of the database, providing clear and concise technical information for future reference.

### **Conclusion**
Designing and implementing a robust database solution for the local community centre in Aberdeen was a rewarding experience. By leveraging MySQL Workbench, I developed an efficient data model, implemented an effective data management system, and utilized SQL queries to analyze and manipulate data. Collaborating with stakeholders ensured the solution aligned with their needs, and thorough testing and documentation guaranteed data integrity and system reliability. This project showcased my ability to create and deliver effective database solutions that address real-world challenges.
